*Laugh through life*

# Hi there 👋, I'm Noah!

This README file was absolutely not written by an AI assistant! <-- That's me, for real, making a joke. I'm only making this README so you scoundrels over at GitHub will finally stop rejecting my student developer application! :( This was mostly written by AI, yes.

<totally_not_written_by_AI>

I'm a student at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), diving deep into the world of computer science and software development.  I'm passionate about using code to solve problems, explore new technologies, and build cool things.

## 🚀 About Me

*   🎓 **Student:** Currently pursuing my degree at Johns Hopkins University.
*   💻 **Coder:**  I enjoy working with Python and JavaScript, and I'm always eager to learn new languages and frameworks.  My projects (mostly private for now!) range from web scraping and data analysis to experimenting with AI and automation.
*   🧠 **Learner:**  I love the challenge of figuring things out, whether it's reverse-engineering a chatbot, understanding how large language models work, or building tools to make my life easier.
*   🎮 **Gamer & More:** When I'm not coding, you can find me solving Rubik's Cubes, playing Old School RuneScape, or catching up on the latest anime.

## 🛠️ My Interests

My coding interests are pretty broad, but here are some areas I'm particularly focused on:

*   **Artificial Intelligence:**  I'm fascinated by the capabilities (and limitations!) of AI. I've been experimenting with prompt engineering, building tools to interact with AI models, and exploring ways to analyze AI-generated content. Several of my private repositories reflect this interest.
*   **Web Scraping & Data Analysis:** I love extracting information from the web and turning it into something useful.  I've built tools for scraping websites, parsing data, and generating documentation from online resources.
*   **Automation:**  If a task can be automated, I'm interested in finding a way to do it!  This includes everything from automating job applications (with ethical considerations, of course!) to building bots for various purposes.
*   **Cybersecurity (Ethical Hacking):** I have created several tools that explore prompt injection, "AI safety filters", and other security measures. I use these utilities for research purposes and to help me better understand evolving cybersecurity landscapes.
* **Open Source (Aspiring):** I appreciate the collaborative nature of open-source development. While most of my projects are currently private, I'm learning best practices and hope to contribute to open-source projects in the future.  I understand the importance of clear documentation and well-structured code.

## 🤝 Connect with Me

I'm always open to connecting with other students and developers! While I don't have many public projects *yet*, I'm active on GitHub and eager to learn from the community.

Thanks for checking out my profile!
